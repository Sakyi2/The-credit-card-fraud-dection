## ✅ Tips

- Use **`sklearn`** for model implementation.
- Consider **undersampling** or **SMOTE** for handling class imbalance.
- Log metrics using **MLflow** or save in `.json` for analysis.
- Push regularly with clear commit messages like `"Add SVM training and ROC curve generation"`.

If you want, I can generate the initial code files (`train_svm.py`, `train_dt.py`, etc.) for you — just say the word.
